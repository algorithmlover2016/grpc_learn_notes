# [kubernetes DaemonSet](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/kubernetes-daemonset#:~:text=A%20DaemonSet%20is%20an%20active%20Kubernetes%20object%20managed,the%20desired%20state%20with%20the%20current%20observed%20state.)
## **Feature**<br>
* **A DaemonSet allows you to overcome Kubernetesâ€™ scheduling limitations and makes sure that a specific app gets deployed on all the nodes within the cluster.**<br>
* **A DaemonSet is an active Kubernetes object managed by a controller. You can declare your desired state, indicating that a specific Pod needs to be present on every node.**<br>
* **The reconciliation control loop is going to compare the desired state with the current observed state.**<br>
    * **If an observed node does not have a matching Pod, the DaemonSet controller is going to create one automatically.**<br>
* **The Pods created by DaemonSet controllers are ignored by the Kubernetes scheduler and exist as long as the node itself.**<br>
* **A DaemonSet creates a Pod on every node by default.**<br>
    * **If necessary, you can limit the number of acceptable nodes by using a node selector. The DaemonSet controller is going to create Pods only on nodes that match the predefined `nodeSelector` field in the YAML file.**<br>

## **exceptionally well suited for long-running services**<br>
* **Logs collection**<br>
* **Node resource monitoring (frameworks such as Prometheus)**<br>
* **Cluster storage**<br>
* **Infrastructure-related Pods (system operations)**<br>

## **Create a DaemonSet**<br>
* The `daemonset-node-exporter.yaml` file below deploys a ***`Prometheus`*** `node-exporter`, within the `monitoring` namespace, to monitor hardware usage metrics on every node in the cluster.<br>

* **apply the `daemonset-node-exporter.yaml` file**<br>
```
kubectl apply -f daemonset-node-exporter.yaml
```
* **confirm state with `describe` command**<br>
```
kubectl describe daemonset node-exporter -n monitoring
```
* **confirm by listing all pods**<br>
```
kubectl get pod -o wide -n monitoring
```
* **get configuration file (`.yaml`) from pod or daemonset**<br>
```
kubectl get daemonsets node-exporter -n monitoring -o yaml
kubectl get pods node-exporter-suffix -n monitoring -o yaml
```
* **Limit Daemonset by node-seclector**<br>
    * **Node selectors are part of the `nodeSelector` field within the DaemonSet YAML file.**<br>
        * **In the following example, a DaemonSet is going to deploy Nginx only on nodes labeled as `ssd=true`.**<br>
        **label a node named node-1 `ssd=true`**<br>

        kubectl label nodes node01 ssd=true

* **`kubectl rollout` command to check the status of a DaemonSet rolling upgrade**<br>
```
kubectl rollout status ds/daemonset-node-exporter -n monitoring
