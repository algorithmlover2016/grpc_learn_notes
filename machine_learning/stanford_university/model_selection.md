Split Data set into three parts: training set(60%), cross validatoin set(20%), testing set(20%).
	1. generate the cost function with different degree of polynomial and then use training set to get theta parameters
	2. use cross validation set to select whih degree will min(J(theta))
	3. use testing set to compute cost function
