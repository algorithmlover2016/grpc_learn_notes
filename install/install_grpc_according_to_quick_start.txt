when build grpc, I encounter a error message:
1. gRPC_ABSL_PROVIDER is "module" but ABSL_ROOT_DIR is wrong
    Solution: reference to https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/15619 and https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/16052
        under grpc folder, run the following command
        git submodule update --init
        and then cd ./cmake/build and run the following command
    cmake -DgRPC_INSTALL=ON \
          -DgRPC_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
          -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MY_INSTALL_DIR \
          ../..

2. thirty-party of zlib git clone fail lead to cmake fail, just need to go to thirty-party/zlib and  git clone https://github.com/madler/zlib

3. third_party/abseil-cpp compile fail because its CMakeList.txt need add one line, which is set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-std=c++11") at the begining.

4. when install abseil-cpp, I encounter a issue:
    CMake Error at cmake_install.cmake:53 (file):
        file cannot create directory: /lib/cmake/absl.  Maybe need administrative privileges.
   this is because I undef MY_INSTALL_DIR. Maybe u change the window, and at that window, u don't export MY_INSTALL_DIR
